    <h2>Minecraft</h2>
    <p>I discovered Minecraft when i was 9 through Youtubers like DrewMC & FusionDroids Minecraft videos. Before I played actual Minecraft, I played clones. I bought Minecraft Bedrock edition when I was 10. I started playing Java edition through Tlauncher legacy on the Packard Bell. Problem though, my biological father still took away my laptop & phone at 22:00, so I instead used his work laptop, but I couldnt run any external executables on the thing, so I had to resort to browser games only, & thats when I discovered Classicube. I would be willing to bet that I spent hundreds of hours, sneakily working on my Classicube world at midnight. This is also perfect for an archival showcase as I for some reason instead of overwriting my world when I made modifications, simply made a new one, giving me a timeline of how the world changed, with timestamps. there are in total, 62 archived worlds.
Servers i frequented a lot at one point:
Wastecraft (Bedrock edition)
Omniarchive (Classicube)
Hypixel (Java edition)

    <h2>People Playground</h2>
    <p>I discovered People Playground when the Youtuber Boffy released a video on it, I've been playing it on & off ever since. But i really started playing when People Playground Youtubers like Karmy, xZeph & Furyun started uploading their People Playground Videos videos. </p>

    <h1>Programming</h1>
    <p>Leant Java mostly for making games on Nokia's & old Samsungs, & for Minecraft Java edition mods.</p>
    <p>I'd say Python is my weakest language in terms of "heres an idea, make it", at least without a lot of online help. My best Python endeavors include creating a screenshot app as a replacement for the default Windows one & turning that into spyware I sent to people I dont like. But most of what i do with Python involves something obscure with ffmpeg & ktinker or the best thing, machine learning. I have used, trained, & created from scratch, transformer models, chatbots & image generators of all types & styles (GANs, diffusion, auto regressive) & when I say styles I don't mean realistic vs painting, I mean 16x16 Minecraft blocks, usable Minecraft skins, & even spectrograms that can be played back as actual music! </p>

  <section class="cross theme">
    <h1>Sexuality & Expression</h1>
    <p>Im gay. Fully realized when I was gay at 13 years old but liked guys way before that (one of my biggest childhood crushes was henry from Kid Danger). I started crossdressing when I was 13, & asked my crush out when I was 14. We've been doing silly boy stuff ever since, & lots of kisssing :3.</p>
    <p>Our relationship dynamic is kinda cool, while I am a top & he's a bottom, we're both equally shy, submissive & emotionally open, which is to say alot. We both crossdress, we usually wear a skirt & comfy hoodie with a bowtie attached to it, I dont worry about the color pallete too much but my boyfriend likes his fit to be pastel pink. I also wear small silver earrings.</p>
